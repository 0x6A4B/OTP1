# Home Assignment: Software Engineering Project Plan

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, your task is to create a short project plan for your software engineering project. The plan should be structured according to the sections outlined below. You must submit your completed project plan in PDF format to the designated Dropbox on Oma by **25th August**.

**Note:** Remember to include your group number at the top of your report.

**Group 9**

## Plan Sections

### 1. Introduction
  - **Project Title**: I-SPY-U
  - **Project Description**: Monitoring of properties or valuables.
  - **Objectives**: A functional and reliable system for sensor management.
  - **Scope**: 
    - **Included**:
        - Server for handling sensor data, client UI for representing and managing sensor devices.
    - **Excluded**:
        - Sensor device is currently excluded in the scope for the 4 first sprints.

### 2. Project Organization
  - **Team Structure**:
    - Eino Ruuth: UI
    - Joonas Karppinen: Server
    - Toni Hirvikallio: Client business logic
    - Niko Meriluoto: DB
  - **Communication Plan**: Daily scrums, weekly meetings and sprint meetings at the beginning of every sprint.
  - **Stakeholder Involvement**: Team members are the sole stakeholders, fully engaged in planning, designing and developing of the product.

### 3. Risk Analysis
  - **Risk Description**:
    - Inadequate timeframe
    - Device malfunctions for sensors, microcontrollers or computers
    - Server malfunctions or breakdowns
    - Software limitations
    - Supply chain issues for sensors and chips
  - **Likelihood**:
    - Timeframe medium
    - Hardware low
    - Software medium
  - **Impact**:
    - Timeframe low
    - Hardware high
    - Software medium
  - **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Timeframe: careful planning
    - Hardware: backup server, microcontroller and sensors
    - Software: thorough research

### 4. Hardware and Software Resource Requirements
  - **Hardware**:
    - Server
    - Microcontroller(s)
    - Sensor(s)
  - **Software**:
    - Docker
    - Ide
    - Spring boot
    - JDK
    - JavaFX
    - MQTT
    - ESP8266 FreeRTOS SDK
    - Jenkins

    - UI is finish-to-finish dependent on businesslogic
    - Backend is finish-to-finish dependent on DB
    - Businesslogic is finish-to-finish dependent on backend
  - **Team Member Assignment**: Responsibilities will be shared

### 6. Project Schedule
  - **Timeline**:
    - requirement gathering
    - design
    - development
    - testing
    - deployment
  - **Milestones**:
    - 

  Important deadlines and checkpoints.
  - **Gantt Chart or Timeline**:

  Visual representation of the schedule (optional but recommended).

### 7. Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms
- Describe how you will monitor progress and report on the project's status, including:
  - **Progress Tracking**: How you will track the completion of tasks and milestones.
  - **Reporting**: How and when updates will be provided to stakeholders and team members (e.g., weekly reports, meetings).






## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: The report should be well-structured and submitted as a PDF.
- **Length**: Aim to keep the report concise and to the point.
- **Submission**: Submit your project plan in the designated Dropbox on Oma by **25th August**.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your project plan will be evaluated based on:
- **Clarity and Structure**: How well-organized and clear the report is.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The completeness of each section.
- **Feasibility and Realism**: How realistic and achievable the plan is.
- **Risk Awareness**: How well potential risks are identified and managed.
- **Adherence to Guidelines**: Whether the plan is submitted on time and follows the required format.
