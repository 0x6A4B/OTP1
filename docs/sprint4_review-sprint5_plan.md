3. **AI Tools Utilized:**
    - List any AI tools used during the sprint.
        - Llama
    - Explain how these tools were used to enhance the project.
        - Llama was used to format a user story in correct format
            - It did the job but poorly so it had to be heavily modified by hand
            - We decided to continue with a template instead in the future as it produces too many mistakes and misunderstandings
